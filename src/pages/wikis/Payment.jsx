                        Although China is transitioning to a cashless economy, carrying cash remains a practical backup option. While technically accepted almost everywhere, cash is less frequently used in urban areas where mobile payments prevail. Relying on cash can be inconvenient and may cause delays if vendors prioritize mobile payments or have limited change. Itâ€™s advisable to keep a small amount of cash for emergencies or rural areas while primarily using mobile payment methods.
